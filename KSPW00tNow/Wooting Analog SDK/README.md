# Source
The files in this folder come from the official repository [Wooting Analog Wrappers](https://github.com/WootingKb/wooting-analog-wrappers) and the Nuget package WootingAnalogSDK.NET.

# Modifications
The SDK was slightly modified to not require NewtonSoft.JSON, which is unnecessary for this project.
Also wooting_analog_wrapper.dll was renamed to wooting_analog_wrapper.bin, since it interfered with the KSP loader.
