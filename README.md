# KSPW00tNow
This repo contains a plugin for Kerbal Space Program which adds support for Wooting keyboards (e.g. Wooting One/Two).
This plugin reads the analog values from the keyboard and applies those instead of the binary controls.

## Features
- Automatically binds to the primary keybindings
- Flight controls (rotate, translate, thrust, steer)
- SAS override (absolute)
- Precision mode with reduced input
- Precision mode applied to thrust
- EVA: variable ladder climb speed
- EVA: variable walk and run speed (CameraFrameMode* on)
- EVA: 360Â° movement (CameraFrameMode* off)
- EVA: jetpack and parachute control

*) CameraFrameMode means whether the Kerbal faces the camera direction or the movement direction. Per default this can be toggled with the Alt key.

## Build
1. Update the assembly references according to the [Wiki page](https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Setting_up_Visual_Studio) of Kerbal Space Program 
2. Choose configuration _Release_
3. Build the solution

## Prerequisites
This plugin requires the [Wooting Analog SDK](https://github.com/WootingKb/wooting-analog-sdk/releases) to be installed. However, that doesn't mean it can only be used with Wooting keyboards, as there are [SDK plugins for other analog keyboards](https://github.com/AnalogSense/universal-analog-plugin).

## Installation
Extract the contents of package\KSPW00tNow.zip into the GameData directory of the Kerbal Space Program install folder.

\<KSPRootDir\>\GameData\KSPW00tNow\Plugins\0Harmony.dll\
\<KSPRootDir\>\GameData\KSPW00tNow\Plugins\KSPW00tNow.dll\
\<KSPRootDir\>\GameData\KSPW00tNow\Plugins\wooting_analog_wrapper.bin
