# KSPW00tNow
This repo contains a plugin for Kerbal Space Program which adds support for Wooting keyboards (e.g. Wooting One/Two).
This plugin reads the analog values from the keyboard and applies those instead of the binary controls.

## Features
- Automatically binds to the primary keybindings
- Flight controls (rotate, translate, thrust)
- SAS override
- EVA: variable ladder climb speed
- EVA: variable walk and run speed (CameraFrameMode* on)
- EVA: 360Â° movement (CameraFrameMode* off)
- EVA: jetpack and parachute control

*) CameraFrameMode means whether the Kerbal faces the camera direction or the movement direction. Per default this can be toggled with the Alt key.
